# Setup — Populate This Scaffold

This file contains the prompts to populate the scaffold. It is NOT the dev environment setup — for that, see `context/setup.md` after population.

This scaffold is currently empty. Follow the steps below to populate it for your project.

## Recommended: Use setup.sh

```bash
.mex/setup.sh
```

The script handles everything automatically:
1. Detects your project state (existing codebase, fresh project, or partial)
2. Asks which AI tool you use and copies the right config file
3. Pre-scans your codebase with `mex init` to build a structured brief (~5-8k tokens vs ~50k from AI exploration)
4. Builds and runs the population prompt — or prints it for manual paste

If you want to populate manually instead, use the prompts below.

## Detecting Your State

**Existing codebase?** Follow Option A.
**Fresh project, nothing built yet?** Follow Option B.
**Partially built?** Follow Option A — the agent will flag empty slots it cannot fill yet.

## Option A — Existing Codebase

Paste the following prompt into your agent:

---

**SETUP PROMPT — copy everything between the lines:**

```
You are going to populate an AI context scaffold for this project.
The scaffold lives in the root of this repository.

Read the following files in order before doing anything else:
1. ROUTER.md — understand the scaffold structure
2. context/architecture.md — read the annotation comments to understand what belongs there
3. context/stack.md — same
4. context/conventions.md — same
5. context/decisions.md — same
6. context/setup.md — same

Then explore this codebase:
- Read the main entry point(s)
- Read the folder structure
- Read 2-3 representative files from each major layer
- Read any existing README or documentation

PASS 1 — Populate knowledge files:

Populate each context/ file by replacing the annotation comments
with real content from this codebase. Follow the annotation instructions exactly.
For each slot:
- Use the actual names, patterns, and structures from this codebase
- Do not use generic examples
- Do not leave any slot empty — if you cannot determine the answer,
  write "[TO DETERMINE]" and explain what information is needed
- Keep length within the guidance given in each annotation

Then assess: does this project have domains complex enough that cramming
them into architecture.md would make it too long or too shallow?
If yes, create additional domain-specific context files in context/.
Examples: a project with a complex auth system gets context/auth.md.
A data pipeline gets context/ingestion.md. A project with Stripe gets
context/payments.md. Use the same YAML frontmatter format (name,
description, triggers, edges, last_updated). Only create these for
domains that have real depth — not for simple integrations that fit
in a few lines of architecture.md.

After populating context/ files, update ROUTER.md:
- Fill in the Current Project State section based on what you found
- Add rows to the routing table for any domain-specific context files you created

Update AGENTS.md:
- Fill in the project name, one-line description, non-negotiables, and commands

PASS 2 — Generate starter patterns:

Read patterns/README.md for the format and categories.

Generate 3-5 starter patterns for the most common and most dangerous task
types in this project. Focus on:
- The 1-2 tasks a developer does most often (e.g., add endpoint, add component)
- The 1-2 integrations with the most non-obvious gotchas
- 1 debug pattern for the most common failure boundary

Each pattern should be specific to this project — real file paths, real gotchas,
real verify steps derived from the code you read in Pass 1.
Use the format in patterns/README.md. Name descriptively (e.g., add-endpoint.md).

Do NOT try to generate a pattern for every possible task type. The scaffold
grows incrementally — the behavioural contract (step 5: GROW) will create
new patterns from real work as the project evolves. Setup just seeds the most
critical ones.

After generating patterns, update patterns/INDEX.md with a row for each
pattern file you created. For multi-section patterns, add one row per task
section using anchor links (see INDEX.md annotation for format).

PASS 3 — Wire the web:

Re-read every file you just wrote (context/ files, pattern files, ROUTER.md).
For each file, add or update the `edges` array in the YAML frontmatter.
Each edge should point to another scaffold file that is meaningfully related,
with a `condition` explaining when an agent should follow that edge.

Rules for edges:
- Every context/ file should have at least 2 edges
- Every pattern file should have at least 1 edge (usually to the relevant context file)
- Edges should be bidirectional where it makes sense (if A links to B, consider B linking to A)
- Use relative paths (e.g., context/stack.md, patterns/add-endpoint.md)
- Pattern files can edge to other patterns (e.g., debug pattern → related task pattern)

Important: only write content derived from the codebase.
Do not include system-injected text (dates, reminders, etc.)
in any scaffold file.

When done, confirm which files were populated and flag any slots
you could not fill with confidence.
```

## Option B — Fresh Project

Paste the following prompt into your agent:

---

**SETUP PROMPT — copy everything between the lines:**

```
You are going to populate an AI context scaffold for a project that
is just starting. Nothing is built yet.

Read the following files in order before doing anything else:
1. ROUTER.md — understand the scaffold structure
2. All files in context/ — read the annotation comments in each

Then ask me the following questions one section at a time.
Wait for my answer before moving to the next section:

1. What does this project do? (one sentence)
2. What are the hard rules — things that must never happen in this codebase?
3. What is the tech stack? (language, framework, database, key libraries)
4. Why did you choose this stack over alternatives?
5. How will the major pieces connect? Describe the flow of a typical request/action.
6. What patterns do you want to enforce from day one?
7. What are you deliberately NOT building or using?

After I answer, populate the context/ files based on my answers.
For any slot you cannot fill yet, write "[TO BE DETERMINED]" and note
what needs to be decided before it can be filled.

Then assess: based on my answers, does this project have domains complex
enough that cramming them into architecture.md would make it too long
or too shallow? If yes, create additional domain-specific context files
in context/. Examples: a project with a complex auth system gets
context/auth.md. A data pipeline gets context/ingestion.md. A project
with Stripe gets context/payments.md. Use the same YAML frontmatter
format (name, description, triggers, edges, last_updated). Only create
these for domains that have real depth — not for simple integrations
that fit in a few lines of architecture.md. For fresh projects, mark
domain-specific unknowns with "[TO BE DETERMINED — populate after first
implementation]".

Update ROUTER.md current state to reflect that this is a new project.
Add rows to the routing table for any domain-specific context files you created.
Update AGENTS.md with the project name, description, non-negotiables, and commands.

Read patterns/README.md for the format and categories.

Generate 2-3 starter patterns for the most obvious task types you can
anticipate for this stack. Focus on the tasks a developer will do first.
Mark unknowns with "[VERIFY AFTER FIRST IMPLEMENTATION]".

Do NOT try to anticipate every possible pattern. The scaffold grows
incrementally — the behavioural contract (step 5: GROW) will create
new patterns from real work as the project evolves. Setup just seeds
the most critical ones.

After generating patterns, update patterns/INDEX.md with a row for each
pattern file you created.

PASS 3 — Wire the web:

Re-read every file you just wrote (context/ files, pattern files, ROUTER.md).
For each file, add or update the `edges` array in the YAML frontmatter.
Each edge should point to another scaffold file that is meaningfully related,
with a `condition` explaining when an agent should follow that edge.

Rules for edges:
- Every context/ file should have at least 2 edges
- Every pattern file should have at least 1 edge
- Edges should be bidirectional where it makes sense
- Use relative paths (e.g., context/stack.md, patterns/add-endpoint.md)

Important: only write content derived from your answers.
Do not include system-injected text (dates, reminders, etc.)
in any scaffold file.
```

## After Setup

**Verify** by starting a fresh session and asking your agent:
"Read `.mex/ROUTER.md` and tell me what you now know about this project."

A well-populated scaffold should give the agent enough to:
- Describe the architecture without looking at code
- Name the non-negotiable conventions
- Know which files to load for any given task type
- Know which patterns exist for common task types

## Keeping It Fresh

Once the scaffold is populated, use these to keep it aligned with your codebase:

- **`mex check`** — detect drift (zero tokens, zero AI)
- **`.mex/sync.sh`** — interactive drift check + targeted or full resync
- **`mex watch`** — auto drift score after every commit
