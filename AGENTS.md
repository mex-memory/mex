# [Project Name]

## What This Is
<!-- One sentence. What does this project do?
     Length: 1 sentence maximum.
     Not a tagline — a factual description of what the software does.
     Example: "A REST API for managing inventory across multiple warehouse locations." -->

## Non-Negotiables
<!-- Hard rules the agent must never violate. Not preferences — rules.
     These are the things that, if broken, cause real damage to the codebase.
     Length: 3-5 items. More than 5 means the list has not been prioritised.
     Example:
     - Never write database queries outside of the repository layer
     - Never commit secrets or API keys
     - Always handle errors explicitly — no silent failures -->

## Commands
<!-- The exact commands needed to work on this project.
     Include: run dev server, run tests, run linter, build.
     Use the actual commands from this codebase — not placeholders.
     For monorepos or projects with separate frontend/backend, group by area.
     Target: keep this entire file under 150 tokens. For full-stack projects
     with separate command sets, up to 200 tokens is acceptable.
     Example:
     - Dev: `npm run dev`
     - Test: `npm test`
     - Lint: `npm run lint`
     - Build: `npm run build` -->

## Scaffold Growth
After every task: if no pattern exists for the task type you just completed, create one. If a pattern or context file is now out of date, update it. The scaffold grows from real work, not just setup. See the GROW step in `ROUTER.md` for details.

## Navigation
At the start of every session, read `ROUTER.md` before doing anything else.
For full project context, patterns, and task guidance — everything is there.
